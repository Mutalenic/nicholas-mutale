            Hello!My name is Nicholas and I enjoy creating web application.I
            have always been curious to know how appilications on the internet
            work and when MOOCs were introduced back in 2008, I was excited to
            increase my knowledge of software development and enrolled in a few
            courses.
          </p>
          <p className="py-6">
            Fast-forward 2022, I enrolled at Microverse, a remote software
            development program that uses pair programming and project building
            to teach development. I spent more than 2000+ hours learning web
            development.

            These are some of the technologies I have been working with
            recently; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Ruby, Ruby on rails
